<h2>Where to start?</h2>
<p>The Visual Editor sure has a lot of options, right?  Don't worry.  I'll help you with the basics.  Just remember the essentials:
<ul>
<li>1. Choose an embed type</li>
<li>2. Provide relevant information.</li>
<li>3. Set options as desired.</li>
<li>4. Choose insert shortcode.</li>
</ul>
<p>First, I'll explain the embed types, and then I'll discuss the global options.</p>
<div id="tabs">
<ul>
<h4>Embed Types:</h4>
<li><a href="#tabs-1">Mix</a></li>
<li><a href="#tabs-2">Collection</a></li>
<li><a href="#tabs-3">DJ</a></li>
<li><a href="#tabs-4">Artist</a></li>
<li><a href="#tabs-5">Tags</a></li>
<li><a href="#tabs-6">Similar</a></li>
</ul>
<div id="tabs-1">
<p>This option is for embedding single mixes from 8tracks.com (<a href="http://8tracks.com/tiagonoronha/rainy-days" target="_blank">Example</a>). You simply find a mix you like, and then drop into the box labeled "Mix URL."</p>
</div>
<div id="tabs-2">
<p>This option is very similar to the single mix option, except for the fact that it returns a collection of mixes (<a href="http://8tracks.com/datadebt/collections/favorite-artwork" target="_blank">Example</a>). This collection is larger and holds multiple mixes in one embed. It's great for curating sets!</p>
</div>
<div id="tabs-3">
<p>In general terms, DJs are users on 8tracks.com (<a href="http://8tracks.com/songsthatsaved" target="_blank">It's me!</a>).</p>
<p>Using this option will create a collection of mixes by a given user.  The "show:" dropdown allows you to specify that you'd like to see a collection of that user's latest mixes, or what s/he has liked, marked to listen to later, already listened to, or finally those mixes that are recommended to him/her.</p>  
<p>As you might guess, this can be useful when you put your own username in there!</p>
<p><h5>Note: You can put DJs either like this: http://8tracks.com/songsthatsaved (useful for names with unusual characters) or like this: songsthatsaved.  The box accepts either format!</h5></p>
</div>
<div id="tabs-4">
<p>The artist option lets you specify a musician you like, and get back a collection of mixes containing that artist (<a href="http://8tracks.com/explore/songs/bon_iver" target="_blank">Example</a>).</p>
<p>The "sort by" dropdown lets you choose three types of collections: Trending (mixes popular right now), New (mixes that are recently made), and Popular (mixes that have been liked by many users over time.</p>
<p><h5>Note: You can only choose one artist.</h5></p>
</div>
<div id="tabs-5">
<p>The tags option lets you search 8tracks by genre, mood, or whatever other meta category through the use of tags or keywords. Simply enter a comma-separated list of things you'd like to find. This search returns a collection of mixes marked with those tags (<a href="http://8tracks.com/explore/hip_hop" target="_blank">Example</a>).</p>
<p>You are also given the option to use your WordPress post's categories or tags.  When you say yes, the plugin grabs these and converts them to tags (as if you'd entered them in the box above) and then uses them to search 8tracks.com.  If one of your categories or tags returns zero results, it is omitted from the search and the rest are used (you'll see a comment in your html source about this when it happens).</p>
<p>Finally, the "sort by" dropdown lets you choose three types of collections: Trending (mixes popular right now), New (mixes that are recently made), and Popular (mixes that have been liked by many users over time.</p>
</div>
<div id="tabs-6">
<p>The similar mixes option lets you take the URL of a mix you like (<a href="http://8tracks.com/songsthatsaved/looting-dad-s-lps" target="_blank">Example</a>), and get back a collection of mixes that have been judged to be similar by data from <a href="http://the.echonest.com/" target="_blank">Echo Nest</a> and <a href="http://last.fm" target="_blank">Last.fm</a> (<a href="http://8tracks.com/mix_sets/similar:371039/player" target="_blank">Example Output</a>).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="opts">
<ul>
<h4>Global Options</h4>
<li><a href="#opts-1">Width</a></li>
<li><a href="#opts-2">Height</a></li>
<li><a href="#opts-3">Player Options</a></li>
<li><a href="#opts-4">Flash</a></li>
</ul>
<div id="opts-1">
<p>Here is where you set the width of your single mixes or collections. As a reference, these default to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Single mixes: 300px</li>
<li>Collections: 500px</li>
</ul>
<p><h5>Width can be entered in either pixels or percent.</h5></p>
</div>
<div id="opts-2">
<p>Here is where you set the height of your single mixes or collections. As a reference, these default to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Single mixes: 250px</li>
<li>Collections: 500px</li>
</ul>
<p><h5>Height can be entered in either pixels or percent.</h5></p>
</div>
<div id="opts-3">
<p>This dropdown has three options that affect the way your mix or collection behaves:
<ul>
<li>1. Shuffle: This randomizes the track order within a mix.</li>
<li>2. Autoplay: This makes the mix or collection start playing as soon as it is loaded.</li>
<li>3. Shuffle+Autoplay: This does both 1 and 2.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="opts-4">
<p>Use Flash Player lets you choose to overrule the plugin's use of the default HTML5 player, in favor of the old, Flash player.</p>
<p><h5>Note: 8tracks will eventually phase out the Flash player. Collections are HTML5 only.</h5></p>
